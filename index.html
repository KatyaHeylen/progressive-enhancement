    <h2>The Story</h2>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <em class="neighbors">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</em> The farmer said, <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <em class="neighbors">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</em> The farmer again said, <em class="farmer">“Maybe"</em>.</p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <em class="neighbors">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</em> and the farmer responded, <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <em class="neighbors">“Isn’t that great!”</em> Again, he said, <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em></p>
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
